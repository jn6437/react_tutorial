reducers/reducer_books -> reducers/index ->

Redux serves to construct the application state
and react provides views to provide that state
react-redux provides clear connection between the two

an application state is generated by reducer funtion (reducer-books.js)
Then reduer/index.js usees combineReduers to provide global application state

**a container is a react component that gets bonded to application state**

redux generated state object that contaied books and mapped that state props to component.
Because state got updated through the reducer, the component re-rendered

**Action Creater**

action will make change to application state

**NOTE**

Application state is different from component state
component state = this.setstate (tutorial 1)
application state = this.props.books (tutorial 2, this)
